### AJAX
Prior to the AJAX era, all web pages worked like traditional web application. All of the data shown on the page was fetched with the HTML-code generated by the server. AJAX is introduced in 2005 on the back of advancements in browser technology to describe a new approach that enabled the fetching of content to web pages using JavaScript included within HTML, without the need to rerender the page.


### Single page app

* Traditional web-page: All of the logic is on the server, and the browser only reders the HTML as introduced.

* Single-page application: Do not fetch all of their pages separately from the server but instead comprise only one HTML page fetched from the server, the contents of which are manipulated with JavaScript that executes in the browser
